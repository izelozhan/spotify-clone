# spotifyish-clone

In this project, I will build a React web application called Jammming. Utilizing my knowledge of React components, state management, and integration with the Spotify API, I aim to create a platform where users can search the Spotify library, curate custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify accounts.

Key Features:

1.Search Functionality

Users can search for songs based on song title.

2.Song Information Display

Users can view detailed information about each song, including title, artist, album, and potentially additional data.

3.Playlist Creation

Users can compile a custom playlist by adding songs from their search results.

4.Export to Spotify

The application will allow users to save their custom playlists directly to their personal Spotify accounts.

I will implement these features using React components to create a dynamic user interface. State management will ensure smooth interaction and updates as users search for songs and build playlists. Integration with the Spotify API will enable seamless access to the Spotify library and the ability to authenticate and save playlists to users' accounts. Overall, the goal is to create a user-friendly and intuitive platform for music discovery and playlist creation.
